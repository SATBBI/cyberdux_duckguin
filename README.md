## Introduction

It is our aim to create conflict with this project.

### Royal Penguin *(Gian)*

![royal pegnuin](images/penguins/royal.jpg)


According to Wikipedia, [*Eudyptes schlegeli*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_penguin) is found only on the sub-Antarctic Macquarie and adjacent islands.

It is very similar in appearance to the macaroni penguin, with which it occationally interbreeds, but is distinguished from that species by its white face.


Royals genereally lay two eggs, but typically, only incubate the second. Both parents share in this responsibility, rotating in 12-day shifts.

The royal penguin is classified in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as 'Least Concern' and its numbers are slowly increasing in the wild.

### Rockhopper *(Abhi, Elizna)*

### African Penguin 🐧 *(Anel)*

It might seem basic, but overlooking basics can have some detrimental effects. In this case, the African Penguin (affectionately known as the Cape Penguin) is currently critically endangered<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_penguin">1</a></sup>.

In my research on the topic, I learned two things:

1. They are the only penguins that (naturally) occur in "The Old World"<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_penguin">1</a></sup>.
2. "The Old World" is a term applied to Asia, Europe and Africa, to note the known world before the discovery of the Americas and Australia<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World">2</a></sup>.

### Yellow-eyed (Emilyn)

What Wikipedia says about me: The yellow-eyed penguin, known also as hoiho (very cute, uh?!), is a species of penguin endemic to New Zealand. It is the sole extant species in the genus Megadyptes (uau!). Previously thought closely related to the little penguin, molecular research has shown it more closely related to penguins of the genus Eudyptes (surpriiiise!). I am part of an endangered population 😔!

### Macaroni Penguin *(Emma)*

![macaroni_penguin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faf3ae95-eb56-435a-9083-a663d5153822)

Macaronis are the most abundant species of penguin, with 18 million individuals worldwide, spread out over the Subantarctic to Antarctic Peninsula.

This penguin’s name refers to a style of hat worn in the 18th century - a man who wore a flashy feather in his hat was called a “Macaroni” (referring to the striking crest feathers of the penguin - stylish gentlemen!).

Their diet consists mainly of crustaceans, squid and fish.

They can hop as well as waddle.


### Chinstrap *(Devon)*
  * The chinstrap penguin (**Pygoscelis antarcticus**) gets its name from the narrow black band under its head, and inhabits a variety of islands and shores in the Southern Pacific and the Antarctic Oceans. ![Chinstrap Penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinstrap_penguin#/media/File:South_Shetland-2016-Deception_Island%E2%80%93Chinstrap_penguin_(Pygoscelis_antarctica)_04.jpg)


### Chinstrap penguin *(Michelle)*

Chinstrap penguins can be found mainly on the Antarctic Peninsula and on islands in the South Atlantic Ocean.
Their conservation status is "least concern", however numbers are declining because of reduction in krill.
They forage any time of the day or night but concentrate efforts around midnight and noon.
Unlike other penguin species they lay two eggs and nurture both chicks during the summer months.
Chinstrap penguins can live to be 16-20 years old.

### Gentoo Penguin *(Alicen)*

Beyond their elegant aesthetics, Gentoo penguins are renowned for their remarkable agility, holding the title of the world's fastest underwater birds<sup><a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/gentoo-penguin">1</a></sup>. These penguins made their Hollywood debut in 2007 with the beloved animated character, Lani, in *Surf's Up*<sup><a href="https://surfs-up.fandom.com/wiki/Lani_Aliikai">2</a></sup>. Gentoo penguins are also known for partaking in a human-like courtship ritual—offering a pebble in exchange for a lifetime partnership<sup><a href="https://www.bbcearth.com/news/the-gift-to-win-a-penguins-heart">3</a></sup>. With their multifaceted charm, these flightless birds are sure to speedily find their way into your heart.
