## Introduction

It is our aim to create conflict with this project. 

### Royal Penguin (Gian)


### Rockhopper (Abhi, Elizna)


### Yellow-eyed (Emilyn)

What Wikipedia says about me: The yellow-eyed penguin, known also as hoiho (very cute, uh?!), is a species of penguin endemic to New Zealand. It is the sole extant species in the genus Megadyptes (uau!). Previously thought closely related to the little penguin, molecular research has shown it more closely related to penguins of the genus Eudyptes (surpriiiise!). I am part of an endangered population :( !
