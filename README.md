Macaronis are the most abundant species of penguin, with 18 million individuals worldwide, spread out over the Subantarctic to Antarctic Peninsula.

This penguin’s name refers to a style of hat worn in the 18th century - a man who wore a flashy feather in his hat was called a “Macaroni” (referring to the striking crest feathers of the penguin - stylish gentlemen!).

Their diet consists mainly of crustaceans, squid and fish.

They can hop as well as waddle.
