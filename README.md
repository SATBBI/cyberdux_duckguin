## Introduction

It is our aim to create conflict with this project. 

### Royal Penguin (Gian)


### Rockhopper (Abhi, Elizna)

### African Penguin üêß (Anel)

It might seem basic, but overlooking basics can have some detrimental effects. In this case, the African Penguin (affectionately known as the Cape Penguin) is currently critically endangered<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_penguin">1</a></sup>.

In my research on the topic, I learned two things:

1. They are the only penguins that (naturally) occur in "The Old World"<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_penguin">1</a></sup>.
2. "The Old World" is a term applied to Asia, Europe and Africa, to note the known world before the discovery of the Americas and Australia<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World">2</a></sup>.

### Add your penguin (and your name)
