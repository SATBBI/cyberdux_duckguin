## Introduction

It is our aim to create conflict with this project. 

### Royal Penguin (Gian)


### Rockhopper (Abhi, Elizna)
I used this [Source]([url](https://www.aquarium.co.za/animals/northern-rockhopper-penguin)) to extract some information about our "friendly" neighbourhood penguins.

- Rockhopper penguins are the smallest of the crested penguin species. They live on rocky, inaccessible coasts in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
- They are renowned for their incredible jumping ability. Rockhoppers lay two eggs and protect them aggressively.
- Parents take turns incubating the eggs, of which only one normally hatches.
